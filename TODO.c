what's going on this project?

OBJECTIVE
all test passed

//test1	//maybe...
//test2
	//tsh need to deal with 'quit' cmd
test3
	//do foreground job - how to test?
	is it ok with bg jobs?	need to implement bg & fg 
test4
	impl bg jobs.
	but how to print ref's output? just use printf???

	t3,t4 test:
	//1. explicit wait test: sh never wait bg explicitly
	2. reaping test: use WNOHANG! 
		can't use criterion. use my on test functions...
		now WRITE SIGNAL HANDLER.

maybe I can check job list.. to test something -> code it!
